## Ahoy, Captain! :smile:

Hi there, welcome to my Github! (Yeah!)
My name is **William Araujo**. I'm from Brazil. I've been working as a **front-end developer** since 2019.
I'm frequently adding new repositories with my personal projects and programming training here at github. á•¦(Ã²_Ã³Ë‡)á•¤

**I'm on my way to be a great programmer!**

Who is William at his free time? Good question! In my free time I enjoy:
- Watching movies and series (ðŸ“º)
- Reading books and japanese mangas (ðŸ“š)
- Listening to music (ðŸŽµ)
- Coding (ðŸ’»)

Where can you find me?
