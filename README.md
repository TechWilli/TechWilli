## Ahoy, Captain! á•¦(Ã²_Ã³Ë‡)á•¤

Hi there, welcome to my Github! (Yeah!)
My name is William Araujo. I'm from Brazil (). I've been working as a front-end developer since 2019.
I'm frequently adding new repositories with my personal projects and programming training.

Who is William at his free time?
Good question! In my free time a enjoy watching movies and series (ðŸ“º), reading books and japanese mangas (ðŸ“š), listening to music (ðŸŽµ) and so on!

Where can you find me?
